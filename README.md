# Garofi

A modest environment variables loader

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'garofi'
```

And run:

```sh
bundle install
```

## How It Works

1. Garofi will load the environment variable defined in `config/application.yml` into your ENV

2. Use Ruby methods to access them:

```ruby
ENV['REDIS_URL']
ENV.fetch('DATABASE_URL')
```
